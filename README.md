**Agentic AI-ready end-to-end testing framework for enterprise contact centers.** Autonomously orchestrates real voice calls, multi-browser CRM verification, and telephony API validation — all in a single declarative test scenario.

> The first open-source tool that tests across telephony, CRM UI, and backend records simultaneously — no mocks, no stubs, real calls.

## Why Agentic Testing?

Traditional contact center testing is **manual, slow, and siloed**. Each tool covers one layer:

| Traditional Approach | Limitation |
|---------------------|------------|
| **UI tools** (Provar, Selenium) | Test the CRM, can't place real calls |
| **Telephony tools** (Twilio scripts) | Make calls, can't verify what the agent sees |
| **API tools** (Postman) | Query records, can't coordinate timing |
| **Manual QA** | Expensive, slow, non-reproducible |

**Audrique is an autonomous testing agent** that orchestrates all three layers in parallel — because contact center bugs live at the boundaries between systems.

## Key Capabilities

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Autonomous call orchestration** | Places real calls via Connect CCP or Twilio REST API, navigates IVR menus with DTMF |
| **Parallel Agentforce testing** | Simultaneous multi-provider calls to validate AI agent concurrency and supervisor monitoring |
| **Transcription-driven IVR** | Local whisper.cpp transcribes IVR prompts in ~2.5 s, matches keywords, sends DTMF on match |
| **Multi-agent browser verification** | 3 parallel Playwright sessions (Agent, CCP, Supervisor) |
| **Declarative scenario DSL** | JSON-based scenarios — no code to write |
| **Visual Scenario Studio** | Drag-and-drop wizard builds scenarios at localhost:4200 |
| **Org auto-discovery** | SOQL-powered discovery of queues, skills, routing, business hours |
| **Video evidence capture** | Parallel recording + FFmpeg merge with speed modulation and annotations |
| **Enterprise security** | Vault integration, zero plaintext secrets, session isolation |
| **CI/CD ready** | Headless execution, structured JSON results, exit codes |

## What You Can Test

| Scenario Type | What It Validates |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Inbound call + agent accept | Call routes correctly, screen pop appears, VoiceCall record created |
| IVR navigation (single/multi-level) | DTMF routing, queue assignment, timeout fallback |
| Skill-based routing | Agent skills matched, PendingServiceRouting records correct |
| Supervisor observation | Queue monitoring, agent offer visibility in Command Center |
| Business hours / closed message | After-hours routing, system prompt, auto-disconnect |
| Voicemail | No-agent fallback, voicemail recorded, SF record created |
| Callback | Queue-full handling, callback task created in Salesforce |
| Real-time transcript | Speech captured, transcript panel updates live |
| Hold / resume / ACW | Full call lifecycle with disposition |
| Agentforce (AI agent) | Parallel calls from CCP + Twilio, AI greeting verification, supervisor active count |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A Salesforce org with Service Cloud Voice enabled
- Amazon Connect instance linked to the org

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/snehalsurti12/audrique.git
cd audrique
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
```

### Configure

```bash
cp instances/default.env.example instances/myorg.env
# Edit instances/myorg.env with your Salesforce + Connect credentials
```

### Capture Auth Sessions

```bash
INSTANCE=myorg npm run instance:auth:sf
INSTANCE=myorg npm run instance:auth:connect
```

### Run Tests

```bash
# Single test
INSTANCE=myorg npm run instance:test:ui:state

# Full E2E suite
INSTANCE=myorg npm run instance:test:e2e:v2

# Dry run (validate without executing)
INSTANCE=myorg npm run instance:test:e2e:v2:dry
```

### Scenario Studio

```bash
npm run studio
# Open http://localhost:4200
```

Visual wizard for building test scenarios — suite management, connection config, advanced settings, run from browser with live output.
